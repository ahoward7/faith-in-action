      <page-text>
        We are continuously seeking dependable volunteers who are willing to generously dedicate their time to those in need. Your cheerful contribution can make a significant difference in the lives of those we assist.</page-text>
      <page-secondary-header>
        We are looking for volunteers who can help with the following:
      </page-secondary-header>
      <fia-bullet>
        Light Housekeeping and Visiting: Requests for aid in light housekeeping and friendly visits are pouring in from the Corning/Painted Post area. Volunteer shortages in this region are hindering our assistance. If you're interested or know someone who could help, please reach out.
      </fia-bullet>
      <fia-bullet>
        Wednesday Drivers Needed: Wednesdays present challenges for finding drivers, especially in the southeastern county (Hornby, Caton, Lindley, Coopers Plains, Corning, Painted Post). Urgent appointments occasionally can't be rescheduled. Could you spare a few hours on Wednesdays to assist?
      </fia-bullet>
      <fia-bullet>
        Drivers Required in Canisteo/Greenwood and Wayland/Cohocton: Additional drivers are needed in Canisteo/Greenwood and Wayland/Cohocton. While grateful for dedicated volunteers making multiple trips weekly, we aim to avoid overwhelming them. Can you help by transporting someone to town once or twice a month?
      </fia-bullet>
      <fia-bullet>
        Tech-Savvy Volunteers for Elderly Care: Seeking individuals with technical skills to connect elderly care recipients with distant loved ones via video conferencing (Skype, Google Hangouts, FaceTime). Bring joy and connection to their lives.
      </fia-bullet>
      <fia-bullet>
        Ramp Building Apprentices: Our ramp building team seeks apprentice volunteers with strength. Currently focused on the western county (Arkport/Hornell/Canisteo), personnel availability is the only limitation. Join our team or learn from them to contribute across STNY. Contact us today!

        Who We Serve
      </page-sub-header>
      <page-text>
        Faith in Action STNY provides services to the elderly living with special needs of STNY, New York. We seek to help those not receiving similar assistance from other programs/social services. Our goal is to be a person's last option, in a most compassionate and caring way. When family members are unavailable, and when other options have been exhausted, Faith in Action can step in and give non-hands on assistance. Often, if we are unable to give the needed assistance, we can refer you to someone that can.
