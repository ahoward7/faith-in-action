          We are continuously seeking dependable volunteers who are willing to generously dedicate their time to those

            Light Housekeeping and Visiting: Requests for aid in light housekeeping and friendly visits are pouring in
            from the Corning/Painted Post area. Volunteer shortages in this region are hindering our assistance. If you're
            interested or know someone who could help, please reach out.

            Wednesday Drivers Needed: Wednesdays present challenges for finding drivers, especially in the southeastern
            county (Hornby, Caton, Lindley, Coopers Plains, Corning, Painted Post). Urgent appointments occasionally can't
            be rescheduled. Could you spare a few hours on Wednesdays to assist?

            Drivers Required in Canisteo/Greenwood and Wayland/Cohocton: Additional drivers are needed in
            Canisteo/Greenwood and Wayland/Cohocton. While grateful for dedicated volunteers making multiple trips weekly,
            we aim to avoid overwhelming them. Can you help by transporting someone to town once or twice a month?

            Tech-Savvy Volunteers for Elderly Care: Seeking individuals with technical skills to connect elderly care
            recipients with distant loved ones via video conferencing (Skype, Google Hangouts, FaceTime). Bring joy and

            Ramp Building Apprentices: Our ramp building team seeks apprentice volunteers with strength. Currently focused
            on the western county (Arkport/Hornell/Canisteo), personnel availability is the only limitation. Join our team
            or learn from them to contribute across STNY. Contact us today!

          Who We Serve
        </PageSubHeader>
        <PageText>
          Faith in Action STNY provides services to the elderly living with special needs of STNY, New York. We seek to
          help those not receiving similar assistance from other programs/social services. Our goal is to be a person's
          last option, in a most compassionate and caring way. When family members are unavailable, and when other
          options have been exhausted, Faith in Action can step in and give non-hands on assistance. Often, if we are
          unable to give the needed assistance, we can refer you to someone that can.
